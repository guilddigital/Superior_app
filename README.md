# Superior config
In the context of refugee settings, Community health work often falls on the shoulders of Voluntary Health Teams (VHTs). 
Significant burden is on VHTs, manifesting in various challenges such as;
  Excessive workloads-a high number of clients to care for
  vast catchment areas to cover
  exacerbated by the lack of adequate supervision 
  Insufficient provision of materials and economic support
Consequently, the need for effective supervision becomes paramount in strengthening the community health system within the refugee setting.

Supervisors are persons that train, coach, and support the work of VHTs in the refugee settlement and assist them to meet their monthly targets. Supervisors usually split their time between administrative duties at the local health facility, partner program offices, and accompanying VHTs on their community visits. They are often Public Health Assistants who possess a certificate in Environmental or Public Health. 

A supervisor app aims to support supervisors with 
  1) quality assurance of VHT activities through assessment of core competencies related to their basic functions
  2) Plan and document VHT supervision activities through registers and reporting reviews
  3) Assess supplies, materials and drug management
